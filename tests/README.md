## Koch Framework - TestSuite

#### Current Test Status [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/KSST/KF.png)](http://travis-ci.org/KSST/KF)

#### Tests Overview

We use Simpletest for running automated tests on the Koch Framework.

For running the complete Testsuite simply call ./tests/runAllTests.php.

If you want to help, we are always looking to improve the Koch Framework code coverage!

You can find the SimpleTest project located at http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpletest/
