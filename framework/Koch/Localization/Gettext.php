/**
 * Koch Framework - Class for handling Gettext Extraction.
 *
 * 1. Gettext extraction is normally performed by the "xgettext" tool.
 *    http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/gettext/xgettext-Invocation.html
 *
 * 2. PHP as a platform is still missing essential features of the gettext toolchain.
 *    You wont' find a PECL extension for extraction NOR native PO/MO writing.
 *    Basically everything is missing - except the reading of compiled gettext files (--with-gettext).
 *
 * 3. The missing parts are implemented in PHP:
 *    a) gettext extractor basedon preg_matching.
 *       The extractor matches certain translation functions, like translate('term') or t('term') or _('term')
 *       and their counterparts in templates, often {t('term')} or {_('term')}.
 *    b) POT/PO/MO File Handling = reading and writing.
 *
 * The Koch_Gettext is based on and inspired by
 *  - Karel Klima's "GettextExtractor v2" (new BSD)
 *  - Drupals "translation_extraction" (GPL)
 *  - Matthias Bauer's work on PO/MO Filehandling for Wordpress during GSoC 2007 (GPL)
 *  - Heiko Rabe's "Codestyling Localization" Plugin for Wordpress (GPL)
