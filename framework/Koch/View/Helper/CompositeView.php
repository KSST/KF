/**
 * Koch Framework - Class for Layout Handling
 *
 * The Layout Object provides a document tree for the output elements.
 * Speaking in patterns: this is a "composite" view (GoF - German Edition - Page 239).
 * To get a better picture of the idea we speak of a tree/leaf(s) or parent/child(s) structure.
 * Every internal-node is-a leaf-node. At the end we render the whole tree.
 *
 * The Purpose is to divide / seperate all controller logic and view logic from each other.
 * Each controller (C) can add an element to the tree (V).
 * Doing this means, that we process all the controller logic before going on to the view logic.
 * First we get all controller's done, then we get all view's done.
 *
 * I know that there are some frameworks out there, which work with another approach,
 * where they switch back and forth between doing controller and doing view logic.
 * But i have decided not to implement it that way.
